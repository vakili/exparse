Parser for simple expressions, implemented using =ReadP=.

Supports prefix functions of zero or more arguments, and infix operators.
An /operator table/ (type =OpTable=) specifies available operators, their precedence and associativity.
Operators of the same precedence are assumed to have the same associativity.

The parser is parametric in the operator table.
