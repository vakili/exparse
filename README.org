~exparse~ is a parser for mathematical expressions, implemented using =ReadP=.
The code was written during a university project at UCPH.

The parser supports prefix functions of zero or more arguments, and infix
operators. An /operator table/ (type =OpTable=) specifies available operators,
their precedence and associativity. Operators of the same precedence are assumed
to have the same associativity.

The parser is parametric in the operator table.
